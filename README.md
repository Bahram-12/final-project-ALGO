This repository contains the source code for the "EV Charging Station Route Optimization" project. The project applies Dijkstra's algorithm to determine the most efficient routes to EV charging stations, aiming to alleviate range anxiety for electric vehicle (EV) drivers.

How It Works The application reads a predefined network of nodes and edges from an external CSV file and constructs a graph data structure. The graph represents a network of roads with distances as weighted edges. Dijkstra's algorithm is then used to calculate the shortest paths from a starting point to various charging stations.

To run this project, you will need Python 3.x installed on your system. Clone the repository and execute the codes.
